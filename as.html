CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and CSS3 are both used to style web pages, but CSS3 is an evolved version of CSS with enhanced features and capabilities. Below is a detailed comparison of CSS and CSS3, focusing on their differences:

### 1. **Definition and Evolution**
- **CSS**: Refers to earlier versions of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS1 and CSS2/CSS2.1), introduced to style HTML elements with basic properties like colors, fonts, margins, and positioning.
- **CSS3**: The latest version of CSS, introduced as a modular upgrade to CSS2.1. It builds on previous versions by adding advanced features like animations, transitions, and responsive design capabilities.

### 2. **Modularity**
- **CSS**: Earlier versions (CSS1, CSS2) were monolithic, with all features bundled into a single specification. This made updates and maintenance challenging.
- **CSS3**: Adopts a modular approach, splitting features into separate modules (e.g., Selectors, Box Model, Animations, Flexbox). Each module can be developed and updated independently, improving flexibility and browser adoption.

### 3. **New Features in CSS3**
CSS3 introduces several advanced features not available in earlier CSS versions:

#### a. **Selectors**
- **CSS**: Limited to basic selectors like element, class, ID, and pseudo-classes (e.g., `:hover`, `:active`).
- **CSS3**: Introduces advanced selectors for precise targeting:
  - Attribute selectors: `[type="text"]`
  - Pseudo-classes: `:nth-child()`, `:not()`, `:first-of-type`, `:last-child`
  - Pseudo-elements: `::before`, `::after` (improved syntax)
  - Example: `div:nth-child(2n)` targets every second div.

#### b. **Border and Background Enhancements**
- **CSS**: Basic border properties (e.g., `border`, `border-color`) and single background images.
- **CSS3**: Adds advanced styling:
  - `border-radius`: Creates rounded corners.
  - `box-shadow`: Adds shadows to elements.
  - `border-image`: Uses images for borders.
  - Multiple backgrounds: `background: url(img1.jpg), url(img2.jpg);`
  - Example: `border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);`

#### c. **Colors and Opacity**
- **CSS**: Limited to hex, RGB, and named colors (e.g., `red`, `#FF0000`).
- **CSS3**: Supports advanced color formats and opacity:
  - RGBA: `rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)` (includes alpha for transparency).
  - HSL/HSLA: `hsla(120, 100%, 50%, 0.5)` (hue, saturation, lightness).
  - `opacity`: Controls element transparency (e.g., `opacity: 0.7;`).

#### d. **Transitions and Animations**
- **CSS**: No built-in support for animations or transitions; relied on JavaScript for dynamic effects.
- **CSS3**: Introduces:
  - **Transitions**: Smooth changes for properties like `color`, `width`, etc.
    - Example: `transition: background-color 0.3s ease;`
  - **Animations**: Keyframe-based animations for complex effects.
    - Example: `@keyframes slide { from { transform: translateX(0); } to { transform: translateX(100px); } }`

#### e. **Transforms**
- **CSS**: No support for transforming elements (e.g., rotate, scale).
- **CSS3**: Adds 2D and 3D transforms:
  - `transform`: `rotate(45deg)`, `scale(1.2)`, `translate(50px, 100px)`, `skew(20deg)`.
  - 3D transforms: `rotateX(45deg)`, `perspective(500px)`.
  - Example: `transform: rotate(45deg) scale(1.5);`

#### f. **Layout Features**
- **CSS**: Relied on `float`, `position`, and `display` for layouts, which were often cumbersome.
- **CSS3**: Introduces modern layout modules:
  - **Flexbox**: Flexible box layout for one-dimensional layouts.
    - Example: `display: flex; justify-content: space-between;`
  - **Grid**: Two-dimensional grid-based layout system.
    - Example: `display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;`
  - **Multi-column Layout**: Creates newspaper-style columns.
    - Example: `column-count: 3; column-gap: 20px;`

#### g. **Media Queries**
- **CSS**: Limited support for responsive design (basic media types like `screen`, `print`).
- **CSS3**: Robust media queries for responsive design:
  - Example: `@media (max-width: 600px) { body { font-size: 16px; } }`
  - Enables adaptive layouts based on screen size, orientation, etc.

#### h. **Fonts and Text Effects**
- **CSS**: Limited to system fonts or image-based text effects.
- **CSS3**: Enhances typography:
  - `@font-face`: Allows custom web fonts.
    - Example: `@font-face { font-family: 'CustomFont'; src: url('font.woff2'); }`
  - `text-shadow`: Adds shadows to text.
    - Example: `text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);`
  - Advanced text properties: `text-overflow`, `word-wrap` (now `overflow-wrap`).

#### i. **Gradients**
- **CSS**: No native support; gradients required images.
- **CSS3**: Supports linear and radial gradients:
  - Example: `background: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);`
  - Example: `background: radial-gradient(circle, yellow, green);`

### 4. **Browser Compatibility**
- **CSS**: Widely supported across all browsers, as it includes basic, long-established features.
- **CSS3**: Some advanced features (e.g., Grid, 3D transforms) may have partial or no support in older browsers. Vendor prefixes (e.g., `-webkit-`, `-moz-`) were often required for early CSS3 adoption, though modern browsers support most features without prefixes.

### 5. **Performance**
- **CSS**: Simpler and lighter, with fewer performance concerns due to basic functionality.
- **CSS3**: Advanced features like animations, transforms, and shadows can impact performance if overused, especially on low-end devices.

### 6. **Use Cases**
- **CSS**: Suitable for basic styling (e.g., colors, fonts, simple layouts).
- **CSS3**: Enables modern, dynamic, and responsive designs without relying heavily on JavaScript or images, ideal for complex layouts, animations, and mobile-friendly websites.

### 7. **Examples**
- **CSS Example** (Basic styling):
  ```css
  div {
    background-color: #ff0000;
    border: 1px solid black;
    margin: 10px;
  }
  ```
- **CSS3 Example** (Advanced styling):
  ```css
  div {
    background: linear-gradient(to right, #ff0000, #0000ff);
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
    transition: transform 0.3s ease;
  }
  div:hover {
    transform: scale(1.1);
  }
  ```

### Conclusion
CSS3 significantly enhances CSS by introducing powerful features for modern web design, such as animations, flexible layouts, and responsive techniques. While CSS remains sufficient for basic styling, CSS3 is essential for creating dynamic, visually appealing, and responsive websites. Developers should use CSS3 for new projects but ensure compatibility with older browsers when necessary.
